Architecture Overview
    MVC layers: Models (domain + persistence), Controllers (HTTP/actions), Views (templates/UI).
    Add services for business rules (selection, stats) and repositories for data access.
    Keep routing simple via a front controller; guard routes with session-based auth.

Directory Structure
    public/ — entry point, assets, router, authentication.
    app/Controllers/ — one controller per feature (Players, Matches, Selection, Stats, Auth).
    app/Models/ — Joueur, Match, Participation, Commentaire.
    app/Repositories/ — SQL/PDO queries per entity.
    app/Services/ — SelectionService, StatsService, EvaluationService.
    app/Views/ — templates (list/detail/forms), partials (_layout, _nav).
    config/ — DB config, app settings (e.g., plain-text auth per your note).
    db/ — schema, migrations, seed data.
    
Model Mapping (from MCD)

    Joueur — fields: id_joueur, nom, prenom, num_licence, date_naissance, taille, poids, statut.
    Match — fields: id_match, date_match, heure, adresse, nom_equipe_adverse, lieu, resultat.
    Participation — fields: id_participation, id_match, id_joueur, poste, titulaire (bool), evaluation.
    Commentaire — fields: id_commentaire, id_joueur, commentaire.
    Relations: Joueur 1..N Commentaire, Joueur 0..N Participation, Match 0..N Participation.

Controllers
    AuthController — login (plain credentials), logout, session guard middleware.
    PlayersController — list/create/update/delete players; manage statut; list/add/delete comments.
    MatchesController — list upcoming/past; create/update; record resultat when finished.
    SelectionController — build match sheet:
    Only upcoming matches and players with statut = Actif.
    Assign poste, mark titulaire vs remplaçant.
    EvaluationsController (or within Selection) — post-match ratings for participants who played.
    StatsController — global W/D/L; per-player KPIs (starter count, replacement count, avg rating, best position, consecutive matches, win percentage).

Views (Templates)
    Layout: header/nav/footer; flash messages.
    Players: list + search, create/edit form, status badge, comments panel.
    Matches: calendar/list, create/edit, result capture, selection link.
    Selection: match sheet editor (starters vs bench, position dropdowns), validation states.
    Evaluations: rating UI (1–5 or stars), only for a_joue participants.
    Stats: global cards + per-player table with sortable columns.

Repositories
    JoueurRepository — CRUD, filter by statut, attach/detach comments.
    MatchRepository — CRUD, upcoming/past filters, set result.
    ParticipationRepository — upsert participants per match, fetch sheet, constraints (unique per match+joueur).
    CommentaireRepository — list/add/delete per player.

Services (Business Rules)
    SelectionService
        Enforces “upcoming match” and “active players only”.
        Validates role/poste consistency (e.g., max number of starters if you decide).
    StatsService
        Global W/D/L counts and percentages.
        Per-player metrics from participations and results.
        Best position = highest average evaluation by poste.
        Consecutive matches played (streak) computed by date order.
    EvaluationService
        Accepts ratings only if player participated (a_joue/presence in sheet).
        Optional normalization or star-to-score mapping.

Routing
    Front controller in public/index.php dispatching to controllers.
    Route groups: /players, /matches, /matches/{id}/selection, /matches/{id}/evaluations, /stats, /login, /logout.
    Protect all routes except /login with session check.

Validation & UX Rules
    Player forms: required identity fields; num_licence unique; status dropdown.
    Match forms: date_match + heure required; lieu restricted; opponent and address required.
    Selection: only active players; prevent duplicate player entries for a match.
    Evaluations: allow only on completed matches or mark separately; rating 1–5.

Data & Integrity
    Unique constraint: (id_match, id_joueur) in Participation.
    Enumerations: statut (Actif, Blessé, Suspendu, Absent), lieu (Domicile, Exterieur), resultat (Victoire, Defaite, Nul).
    Nullable: resultat, evaluation until available.

Security & Sessions
    Use session-based guard; store only username (per note: no DB users).
    Add CSRF token to forms; validate request methods.
    Escape output in views; validate/clean inputs on controllers.

Collaboration Plan (Two Teammates)
    Teammate A (Data & Features)
        Set up DB schema/migrations and repositories.
        Implement Players + Comments CRUD.
        Implement Matches CRUD + result capture.
    Teammate B (Flows & Analytics)
        Implement Selection builder and Evaluations flow.
        Implement Stats service + views.
        Build shared layout, nav, and authentication controller.

Milestones
    M1: Skeleton MVC, routing, auth guard, base layout.
    M2: Players and Matches CRUD with validations.
    M3: Selection builder (upcoming matches, active players).
    M4: Evaluations and persistence.
    M5: Stats views and exports.
    M6: Polish (form errors, pagination, sorting, minimal tests).
